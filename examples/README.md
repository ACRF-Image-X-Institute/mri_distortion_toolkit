# examples

This is the source code for the examples, which is exaplined in detail [here](https://acrf-image-x-institute.github.io/MRI_DistortionQA/examples.html)
These examples are numbered in the order you might use them in a typical workflow.

All the examples will run independently using the data in _example_data, except for 1_marker_extraction, _6_distortion_correction, and _7_end_to_end. These examples all required data which is not stored in this repository, but which is available [here](https://cloudstor.aarnet.edu.au/plus/s/Wm9vndV47u941JU). 

Similarly, all examples except for 1, 6 and 7 are subject to continuous integration testing to ensure they run - so they should!
