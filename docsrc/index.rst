MRI Distortion QA
=================
`This code <https://github.com/image-x-institute/mri_distortion_toolkit>`_ enables characterization and reporting of geometric distortion in Magnetic Resonance Imaging. The basic end-to-end workflow is below, but all steps have well defined input/output so you can use any part of this code independently from the other parts. For a tutorial on each step, see the "worked examples".
