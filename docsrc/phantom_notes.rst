MRI_DistortionPhantom
=====================

Geometric distortion in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a serious problem. The purpose of this code is to provide code such that users can automatically build a simple and cheap MRI distortion phantom to characterise MRI distortion.


Compared to other MRI distortion phantoms, this is:

- Free and open source
- Completely user customizable
- Water free: light weight and leak free
- Designed for cheap and easy construction
